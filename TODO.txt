Current Focus:
 - Implement chest with barrel / crate texture.

Next Focuses:
 - Consolidate graphics initialization + usage.
 - Consolidate world initialization + usage.
 - Consolidate UI initialization + usage.
 - Cleanup game init and access to graphics/gui/world etc.
 - Create first pass at entity factory system.
 - Make camera an entity, refactor tweening to tween any entity towards another.


TODO infrastructure:
 - Implement chests
 - Implement game state persistence
    - Store tiles

TODO game features:
 - Player can store items in a chest


Dynamic tile system

    How to render dynamic tiles
    How to choose what dynamic tiles to tick
    How to iterate dynamic tiles


    How to initialize?
        ChunkLoader(textureAtlas) <- uses internal tile factory for logic tiles? If not pass in custom tile factories
        ChunkLoader.load(map, layer, chunkX, chunkY)


NPC AI
 - Has a set of values etc.
    - Money (0.3)
    - Food (0.3)
    - Kindness (0.4)
    - Craftsmanship (0.5)
    - Fun (0.3)

 - Values shape their goals
    - Create farm / increase size of farm.
    - Decides on a goal that can increase fulfilment of values
    - Decisions are based upon theories

 - Theories
    - Small farm will make enough food
    - Large farm will make lots of money
    - Medium farm will cost too much money

 - GOALS
    - New goals
    - Make a plan
    - Begin executing actions to get closer to the goal

    EX: Build a fence
        - Decide size + location
            - based on owned land ? (How much should be fenced off)
            - based on currency ? (How much resources will be needed)
            - based on resources (How much resources does he have)
        - Steps to build
            - buy wood ?
            - walk to woodpile
            - pick up wood ?
            - walk to fence section
            - build section
            - pickup wood




Example NPC progression
 - Decide to do something randomly
    - Create farm
 - Creates farm
 - Money starts to go up
 - Associate increase in farming with increase in money
 - Expand farm
 - Money goes up
 - Npc now knows that bigger farm = less money
 - Npc decides to not fertilize farm
 - Crop yields less, money goes down
 - Npc knows that not fertilizing = less money



Things to do:
    Mine
        - prospecting mechanic
        - strip mines take up large areas of land,
        - underground mines possible for some resources.
    Farming
    Engineering
        - Factorio style mechanics
        - Small scale engineering allows players to customize + optimize blocks by developing a technology.
